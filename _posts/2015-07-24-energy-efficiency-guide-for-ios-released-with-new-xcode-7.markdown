Apple released ["Energy Efficiency Guide for iOS Apps"][docs] few days ago when
releasing Xcode 7 beta 4. Note about this document is in the change log.

Not all people read change log so I would like to mention this document here.

I noticed that recently Apple cares about energy more than usually. I read this
new document and would like to recommend to read it for everyone. You can find
there a lot of system-level informations and tips how to use energy efficiently.

Document describes how system works e.g. with WiFi antenna or 3G/LTE or how
timers are used by the system, how to deal with disk I/O operations or
networking stuff, etc.
