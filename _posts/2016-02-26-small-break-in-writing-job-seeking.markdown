Hey everyone. Thanks for reading my blog. I see many people visit the blog and
I am very happy to see that (~50,000 pageviews)!

As you probably know from the header note of the blog, **I am looking for a job**
for a while now, and will be looking for a next month or so, I guess.

I'll probably find some time to post a new blog posts, but I am mainly focused
on finding new job.

If you know any California (San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles)* companies that have own products and looking for an iOS engineer to help them make those products better, I'd love to hear about them!

Wish me luck!
